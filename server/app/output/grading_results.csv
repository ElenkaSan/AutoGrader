Assignment 3_ak4249_attempt_2025-05-30-16-36-09_Alexey_Kuraev_INFO212_Assignment3.ipynb,92,"I'll evaluate the student's code based on the rubric for each question and provide a detailed score and feedback.

Final Score: 92

What is wrong:
- In Question 1, the column renaming could be more consistent and comprehensive
- In Question 2, the method for identifying multiple prize winners is slightly overcomplicated
- In Question 3, the affiliation counting method could be simplified
- In Question 4, some plots lack detailed formatting and annotations

What can be improved:
- Add more detailed comments explaining the data transformation steps
- Implement error handling for edge cases in data processing
- Use more consistent naming conventions across different code sections
- Include more comprehensive data validation checks
- Add more detailed interpretations of the visualization results
- Optimize code for performance, especially for large datasets
- Consider using more advanced statistical techniques for deeper insights
- Enhance the readability of complex data manipulation code
- Provide more context in discussion sections about the implications of the data analysis

Specific strengths of the submission:
- Comprehensive approach to data analysis
- Creative use of different pandas and matplotlib techniques
- Good understanding of data transformation and visualization
- Thoughtful discussions and interpretations of results
- Effective use of different methods to solve similar problems

The score of 92 reflects a high-quality submission with only minor areas for potential improvement."
Assignment 3_am4952_attempt_2025-06-04-15-45-01_Arielle_Madeam_INFO212_Assignment3-2.ipynb,93,"Let me evaluate the solution based on the provided rubrics:

Final Score: 93

What is wrong:
- For Question 1, the code doesn't explicitly list the number of tables read (although the print statement suggests an answer)
- In the continent mapping function, some countries are manually fixed, which indicates the automatic mapping isn't perfect
- In the final discussion of population growth (Question 7), the explanation could be more comprehensive about factors influencing population changes

What can be improved:
- Add more explicit comments explaining the data processing steps
- Enhance the error handling in the continent mapping function
- Provide a more nuanced discussion of population growth factors in the final section, potentially including economic, social, and environmental considerations
- Could add more visualizations to support the population growth analysis
- The code could benefit from more modular function design, especially in data preprocessing steps

The solution demonstrates strong technical skills, comprehensive data analysis, and good use of pandas, matplotlib, and other libraries. The student shows a solid understanding of data manipulation, visualization, and interpretation across multiple complex datasets.

The score reflects excellent technical execution with room for minor improvements in documentation, error handling, and analytical depth."
Assignment 3_ap3748_attempt_2025-06-07-19-34-53_Alex_Patrone_INFO212_Assignment3(1).ipynb,45,"I'll evaluate the student's code based on the provided rubrics and create a comprehensive review.

Let's break this down systematically:

Scoring for Question 1 (Population Data):
- The student implemented most of the required tasks
- Plotted population for top 10 countries
- Added continent mapping
- Handled data preprocessing

Issues:
- Did not fully complete all 7 parts of the rubric
- Missing some detailed analysis
- Some parts of the code are incomplete

Scoring for Question 2 (Nobel Prize Laureates):
- Successfully normalized JSON data
- Counted unique laureates
- Some initial data preparation
- Incomplete implementation of the specific requirements

Issues:
- Did not develop two distinct methods for identifying multiple prize winners
- Did not list top 5 affiliations
- No visualization of prize categories
- Missing comprehensive analysis

Scoring for Questions 3 and 4:
- No complete implementation of these questions
- Code is mostly placeholder or missing

Overall Assessment:

Final Score: 45

What is wrong:
- Incomplete implementation of assignment requirements
- Missing detailed analysis for most questions
- Lack of comprehensive data exploration
- Incomplete code for several sections

What can be improved:
- Complete all sections of each question thoroughly
- Add detailed comments explaining the logic behind each solution
- Implement multiple methods as requested in the rubric
- Create comprehensive visualizations
- Provide in-depth analysis and discussion for each part
- Ensure all code runs without errors
- Handle edge cases and provide robust solutions

Recommendations:
1. Carefully read and follow each part of the rubric
2. Implement complete solutions for each sub-question
3. Add error handling and data validation
4. Create meaningful visualizations with proper labeling
5. Include detailed comments explaining the approach
6. Provide insightful discussions for analytical questions"
Assignment 3_ap3886_attempt_2025-05-30-14-27-00_INFO212_Assignment3_Anastasiia_Poverenova.ipynb,95,"I'll carefully evaluate the student's submission based on the detailed rubrics for each question and provide a comprehensive assessment.

Final Score: 95

What is wrong:
- In Question 1, Part 7 (population growth discussion), the analysis lacks depth in explaining the factors behind population growth rate changes
- In Question 3, Part 7 (weather data correlation), the discussion of relationships between variables is somewhat superficial
- In Question 4, Part 7 (activity data pairwise relationships), the interpretation of the pairplot could be more detailed

What can be improved:
- Add more substantive discussions about population growth dynamics, considering socio-economic and demographic transitions
- Provide more nuanced explanations of correlations between weather measurement variables
- Include specific statistical insights and potential predictive relationships in the activity data pairplot analysis
- Enhance comments explaining the code logic and methodological choices
- Consider adding more advanced statistical tests to validate observations

The student demonstrated excellent technical skills, comprehensive data handling, and created informative visualizations across all assignments. The code is clean, well-structured, and shows a strong understanding of data science programming techniques using pandas, matplotlib, and other libraries. The near-perfect score reflects the high quality of work with only minor areas for potential enhancement."
Assignment 3_asm477_attempt_2025-06-13-20-50-22_Ayush_Madabushi_assignment3 .ipynb,92,"Let me assess the code comprehensively:

Final Score: 92

What is wrong:
- Minor data processing inconsistencies in some code blocks
